# Lartify
Lartify is a laravel starter project template.

## ðŸš§ Work in progress.
The template is likley unstable and not everything is tested yet.
Use at your own risk!

## Installation using fast_start.sh

For easier install, you can use the fast_start.sh script to get started more quickly.<br>
Benefits are:
* Ability to define a project name which is set in every relevant file
* Ability to automatically install frontend and backend dependencies
* Auto-Run migrations
* Auto-Generate app keys

How to run?
* First, run `ddev start` to start, followed by `ddev ssh` to get into the container
* Next, make the script executable by running `chmod +x fast_start.sh`
* Then, call the script using `./fast_start.sh` and follow the instructions

Note: You *can* use the script without ddev on a generic linux host.
It will automatically determine if it is running inside of ddev or not.
